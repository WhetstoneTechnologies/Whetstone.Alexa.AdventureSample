# SpaceFacts -- Module 6 - Use an Audio File

## Introduction

This module adds the use of a media file. If you completed module 4, then you have deployed to Azure and updated the Alexa Skill to point to the deployed Azure Function. To test this functionality locally, your Alexa Skill needs to point to your ngrok tunnel. Make sure you've started an ngrok tunnel and updated the Alexa Skill endpoint with the address of the tunnel.

### Use a Hosted Alexa Sound

When hosting a REST API that services Alexa requests, Amazon requires the service to validate signed calls using certificates. For more information about this process, see [Host a Custom Skill as a Web Service](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-a-web-service.html) in Alexa documentation.





### Fill out the Distribution Form

This distribution form drives when appears in the public listing of the Alexa Skill. Fill this out, including key words and icons. Key words are used when applying nameless invocation.
